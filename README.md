## summary

:hash: **About the project** :arrow_down:

This is a practice project of my frontend development practice project series. Where I want to gain more experience in Website Design. While doing this project I have learned and gained some clear thoughts about CSS position property, CSS content properties and also sharpen my knowledge of Responsive Website Designing.

:hash: **About the website** :arrow_down:

This is basically a school website where schools can use it as their portfolio and sell their school programs and clients can get an overview of the school and book a class for their child.
